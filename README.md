![image](/images/Screenshot%202024-10-07%20at%2014.32.28.png)

A semester project focused on creating an auction website where users can list items for auction, bid on items listed by other users, and manage their credits.

## Description

This project is a front-end application that connects to an existing API to create a functional auction website. Users can create accounts, add items for auction, and place bids on listings. Non-registered users can browse and search through available items, but only registered users can participate in bidding. The site also includes features for profile management and bid history tracking.

Key features of this auction website include:

- **User Registration and Login:** Only users with a stud.noroff.no email can register.
- **Profile Management:** Users can update their avatars and view their total credits.
- **Listing Creation:** Registered users can create item listings with a title, deadline, media gallery, and description.
- **Bidding:** Users can bid on listings created by other users.
- **Bid Viewing:** Users can view all bids made on a particular listing.
- **Search Functionality:** Both registered and non-registered users can search through available listings.
